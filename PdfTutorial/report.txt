There are a number of different ways to organize the experience of the agent. For this thesis, we use the episodic formulation. The agentâ€™s experience is grouped into episodes or trials. At the beginning of each trial, the environment is reset (the state is drawn from p0). The agent interacts with the environment until the end of the trial when the environment is reset again and the cycle continues. The agent is aware of the trial resets. We are using fixed-length episodes: a trial lasts for a set number of time steps. The current time step index may or may not be available as part of the observations (it is not available for any the problems in this thesis).
