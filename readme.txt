ReinforcementLearning

Reinforcement learning works in a cycle of sense-action-goals i.e, how to map situations to actions and actions to rewards, so as to maximize the final reward of the goal state. Learners discover the action that yields most reward by exploring the possible actions. Actions may affect not only the immediate reward but also all the subsequent rewards. The two most important distinguishing features of Reinforcement learning are first trial and error search and second delayed reward.

To shed more light on this subject, we discussed about two Reinforcement learning strategies namely Z learning and Q learning and how effective they are in solving the discrete markov decision problems. In the end we summarized our results and compared these two strategies.
